# ROCKNIX-and-ArkOS-ROM-Drive

## ROCKNIX & ArkOS - Together in Harmony

This is a simple collection of scripts that attempt to create a unified NTFS partition that can be used by both ROCKNIX and ArkOS. Using symbolic links, this script unifies the common systems into single ROM directories. Any systems not in common are created is regular directories.

### Instructions

- Format your SD card to NTFS.
- Copy all of the files from the `dist` directory into the root of the SD card you just formatted.
- In File Explorer, hold *Shift* and, with the mouse cursor, *right click* the drive representing your SD card and select *Open in Windows Terminal*.
- Type `.\execute.ps1` and press *Enter*.
- Wait a little bit
- Profit.
